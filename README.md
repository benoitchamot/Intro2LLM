# Intro2LLM
This repo includes notebooks and notes I use as I learn about LLMs and their application. Some code is mine and some is borrowed from other developers and teachers. I try to always cite my sources. If you recognise code that is yours and is not properly cited, please get in touch with me so I can fix it.
